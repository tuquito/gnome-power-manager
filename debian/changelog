gnome-system-tools (2.29.3-0ubuntu1) lucid; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (LP: #506365)
    - Move to new System Tools Backends protocol (new liboobs API).
      We now only commit changes to one user at a time, reducing the 
      risk for dangerous bugs.
    - Include default profiles configuration file (user-profiles.conf). 
      Distributors should modify it to suit their needs and send them 
      back for inclusion.
    - When creating an user, don't force UID, main group, home directory 
      and shell: these parameters are now handled (better) by the platform 
      tools (LP: #488158, LP: #313990)
    - Allow removing home directory when deleting an user (LP: #426125).
    - Don't allow deleting the last administrator account, and warn when 
      the user is losing its own admin rights. Same for active users 
      (LP: #25947, LP: #349453)
    - Don't allow creating a group with an existing GID (LP: #491434)
    - Use UID and GID ranges defined by liboobs, depending on the platform's 
      abilities.
    - Clear suggested login entry when Real name is emptied in the new user 
      dialog.
    - Change GConf "showall" option to apply only on users. System groups are 
      always shown, since they are the most interesting ones.
    - Various UI and string improvements.
    - Change password for current user by running 'passwd', to avoid 
      breaking keyrings and encrypted dirs
    - Ask for PolicyKit authentication when it most makes sense, i.e. 
      when showing dialogs
    - Option to set encrypted home directories when creating users (on 
      platforms that support it) (LP: #302870)
    - When editing one group, only commit changes to that group
    - When changing Real name, update it in the users list (LP: #498970)
    - Select current user on start, and the first one after selected user 
      has been deleted
    - Don't force updating configuration twice on start
  * Also fixes LP: #344182, LP: #208057, LP: #188757, LP: #372695, 
    LP: #99276, LP: #160862
  * debian/control:
    - Bump liboobs-dev build-dep to 2.29.3
  * debian/gnome-system-tools.install:
    - Don't install debian/profile
    - Install upstream user-profiles.conf instead
  * Delete debian/profiles
  * Refreshed patches:
    - 25_sambashare_group_definition.patch
    - 90_relibtoolize.patch
  * Dropped debian/patches/85_user_gnome_about_me_for_password.patch:
    - The change is obsolete in the new version
  * debian/patches/82_gst-packages-time-admin.patch:
    - Updated to remove superfluous UI file changes, causing focus issues
      in the users-admin password change dialog. Thanks to Will for
      spotting this (LP: #501976)

      + Add build-dep on libpango1.0-dev

    - debian/patches/80_gst-packages-common.patch:
      + Used by previous 2 patches
    - debian/patches/85_user_gnome_about_me_for_password.patch:
      + Use gnome-about-me to change the active users password. 
        gnome-about-me doesn't force the change as root, and so allows 
        things (e.g. ecryptfs) in the PAM stack to access the old password 
        as it is changed. (LP: #307019)

ximian-setup-tools (0.6.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a missing perl dependency. I had used dh_perl for that, but the perl
  scripts that the package include use #!/usr/bin/env perl, instead of 
  #!/usr/bin/perl which is the line recognized by dh_perl.
  
  * Linked all the binaries manpage with the undocumented(7) manpage.
  * debian/rules: now support DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
